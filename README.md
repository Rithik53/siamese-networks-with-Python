Building image pairs for siamese networks with Python


When training siamese networks we need to have positive pairs and negative pairs:

Positive pairs: Two images that belong to the same class (ex., two images of the same person, two examples of the same signature, etc.)
Negative pairs: Two images that belong to different classes (ex., two images of different people, two examples of different signatures, etc.)
